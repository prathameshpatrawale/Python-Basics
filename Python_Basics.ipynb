   "source": [
    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    " > Python is a versatile, highlevel programing language it is known for its readability, simplicity and it's a beginer friendly language. It is popular due to easy to use and has vast collection of libraries and has strong active cummunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    " > An interpreter in Python is a program that directly executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-executable instructions. The Python interpreter converts code into bytecode before running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    " > The predefined keywords in python which are reserved words that have specific meaning and functions, they can not used as veriable or functions names. eg. for,while,and,or,none.def,class,print,try etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    " > No, keywords are not used as variable names Beacuse keywords are reserved in python for specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    " > mutability refers to the ability to modify data structures wuthout creating new copy. eg. list,set,dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    " > Because list can be modified/change easy without making copy so,they are mutable. But, tuples are not changable/modified so,they are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    " > The \"==\" operator checks if value of two objects are equal, while \"is\" operator check if two objects refer to same memmory location or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    " > Logical operator in python are \"and\" , \"or\" and \"not\". while, \n",
    " \"and\" operator Returns 'True' if both conditions are True. otherwise returns  False .\n",
    " \"or\" operator Returns 'False' if both conditions are False. otherwise returns True.\n",
    " \"not\" operator Return 'Reverse' of result. if condition is 'True' it return 'False' voice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    " > The type casting is the changing of one data types to another data type if it is valid. eg. 'str','int','float','list','set','tuple',dict. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    " > The \"Implicit\" type casting means automatically converts one type to another. eg. 5 + 6.5 this gives 11.5 result. where, 5 is 'int'and 6.5 is 'float' so, 'int' convert to 'float'automaticaly while adding. This is implicit type casting.\n",
    " \"Explicit\" type casting is the manually changing one type to another. eg. if we have number in 'str' format \"45\" so, we have to manually convert it into 'int' like this int(\"45\") this is explicit type casting.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    " > Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on specific conditions. They help control the flow of a program by executing code blocks when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
    " > The elif statement allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially after an if statement. If the previous if condition is false, the elif condition is evaluated. If the elif condition is true, its block executes; otherwise, the next condition is checked..\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    " > \"for loop\" is mostly used to iterate over an elements in data types, it has range function also to iterate between given numbers, it is used when number of iteration is know.\n",
    " \"while loop\" is most used to iterate if number of iteration not known and its depends on conditions that might be not known in advance,it repeats block of code till condition is true, it have need to give condition for incrementing or decrementing niether it becomes infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    " > Whenever the number of iteration are not known but we have condition then we have to use while loop insted of for loop. eg. if we want to calculate sum of n natural numbers. we have to use while loop.\n"
